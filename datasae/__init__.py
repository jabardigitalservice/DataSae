This is a standalone Python script that is used to execute a specific task.

Task:
- Generate a new version of the code snippet, with an additional docstring.
- Make sure the docstring starts and ends with standard Python docstring signs.
- The docstring should be in standard format. Use the 'Code Explanation' only
    as a reference, and don't copy its sections directly.
- Except for the docstring, the new code should be identical to the original
    code snippet. Keep existing code comments, line comments, blank lines,
    formatting, etc.
